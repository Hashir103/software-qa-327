====================================
CISC 327 Assignment 3
Nov 2, 2023
Group 23
Hashir, Daniel, Jimmy
====================================
Set-Up:

1. Please ensure you have PyMongo installed (pip3 install pymongo)
2. db.py has the uri string empty (for the TA version, it will be with the ZIP file). Replace string with MongoDb credentials
3. Run main.py from the main directory folder so that all dependancies are accounted for properly
====================================
To-Do:

1. Create a separate MongoDb account for the TA to look at our Customer/Restaurant Collections
2. Verify our 9? tests work with the implementation (I tested everything so it should be fine, but just double check)
3. Finish off whatever else we need to do with the Assignment
