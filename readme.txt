====================================
Set-Up:

1. Please ensure you have PyMongo installed (pip3 install pymongo)
2. db.py has the uri string empty (for the TA version, it will be with the ZIP file). Replace string with MongoDb credentials
3. Run main.py from the main directory folder so that all dependancies are accounted for properly
